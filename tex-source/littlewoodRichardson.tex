\section[littlewoodRichardsonModels]{Combinatorial models for Littlewood--Richardson coefficients}

The \hyperref[schurLittlewoodRichardson]{Littlewood--Richardson coefficients} are defined as the structure constants
$c^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu}$ appearing in the 
expansion $\schurS_\mu \schurS_\nu = \sum_\lambda c^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu} \schurS_\lambda$.
One can show that $c^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu}=0$ unless $\mu,\nu \subseteq \lambda$.
Furthermore, we have the symmetries
\[
c^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu} = c^{\lambda}_{\nu\mu} = c^{\lambda'}_{\mu'\nu'}.
\]
A simple recursion for computing $c^{\lambda}_{\nu\mu}$
can be obtained from the \hyperref[schurShiftedLittlewoodRichardson]{shifted Schur functions}.

The Littlewood--Richardson coefficiens \hyperref[kostkaFromLR]{generalize the skew Kostka coefficients}.


In \cite{Azenhas1999}, it is proved that for fixed $\lambda$ and $\mu$, the set
\[
 \{ \nu : c^{\lambda}_{\mu \nu}>0 \}
\]
is a sub-lattice of the partition lattice under domination order.
See also \cite{TaskinGumus2022x} for conditions on when $c^{\lambda}_{\mu \nu}$ is positive.


The problem of determining for which $(\lambda, \mu, \nu)$ we have $c^{\lambda}_{\nu\mu} > 0$,
is determined by the \defin{Horn inequalities}, see \cite{Klyachko1998,KnutsonTau1999}.



\subsection[lrTableaux]{Littlewood--Richardson tableaux}

The Littlewood--Richardson rule states that $c^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu}$ count the number of 
skew semi-standard Young tableaux of shape $\lambda/\mu$ with content $\nu$,
with the additional restriction that the concatenation of the reversed rows is a \defin{lattice word}.
A word $w_1,\dotsc,w_\ell$ is a lattice word if every prefix has the property that its content is a partition.
That is, the number of times $i$ appears in the prefix is at least as many as $i+1$, for every $i$.
Tableaux of this type are called \defin{Littlewood--Richardson tableaux}.

\begin{example*}[Littlewood--Richardson tableaux]
Consider the coefficient of $\schurS_{542}$ in the product $\schurS_{32}\cdot \schurS_{321}$.
We must find all Littlewood--Richardson tableaux of shape $542/32$ with content $321$.
There are two such tableaux:
\begin{figure}
\begin{ytableau}
\none & \none & \none & 1 & 1 \\
\none & \none & 1 & 2 \\
2 & 3
\end{ytableau}
\begin{ytableau}
\none & \none & \none & 1 & 1 \\
\none & \none & 2 & 2 \\
1 & 3
\end{ytableau}
\end{figure}
Consequently, $c^{542}_{32,321}=2$.
\end{example*}


\subsection[lrYamanouchi]{Semistandard Young tableaux}

In \cite[Cor. 5.4.8 ]{Lothaire2002}, they give the following 
characterization of Littlewood--Richardson coefficients: 
$c^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu}$ is the number of semistandard Young tableaux $T$
with shape $\nu$, and content $\lambda-\mu$ such that
$\rw(t) \cdot \ell^{\mu_\ell} \dotsm 2^{\mu_2}1^{\mu_1}$ is a Yamanouchi word.

By using \cite[Rem. 14 and Cor. 21]{KaliszewskiMorse2019}, 
one can show that this is equivalent to the following model.


\subsection[lrMolevSagan]{Semistandard Young tableaux II}

In \cite{FominGreene1993,MolevSagan1999}, the following model us described.
$c^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu}$ is the number of semistandard 
Young tableaux $T$ with shape $\mu$, with the property that 
the column index reading word of $T$, \defin{fits} the skew shape $\lambda/\mu$.
That is, we take the column reading word of $T$, reading columns right to left.
This gives a word $w$. For each entry $w_i$, we put an entry $i$ in row $w_i$,
so that the resulting filling $F=F(T)$ is of shape $\lambda/\mu$.
If this filling is a skew SYT, then we say that $T$ fits $\lambda/\mu$.

Note that the conditions force that $T$ has content $\lambda-\mu$.

Observe that this model is generalized to Littlewood--Richardson coefficiens for
\hyperref[schurShifted]{shifted Schur functions}.


\begin{example*}[Fomin--Greene model]
Let us show that $c^{542}_{321,32}=2$ using the Fomin--Greene model.
We are counting SSYT with shape $\mu=321$,
which fit $542/32$.

There are two such SSYT (and corresponding SYT obtained from the column reading word):
\begin{figure}
\begin{ytableau}
1 & 1 & 2\\
2 & 3 \\
3
\end{ytableau}
\begin{ytableau}
\none & \none & \none & 2 & 4 \\
\none & \none & 1 & 5 \\
3 & 6
\end{ytableau}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\begin{ytableau}
1 & 1 & 3\\
2 & 2 \\
3
\end{ytableau}
\begin{ytableau}
\none & \none & \none & 2 & 4 \\
\none & \none & 3 & 5 \\
1 & 6
\end{ytableau}
\end{figure}
Consequently, $c^{542}_{32,321}=2$.
\end{example*}


\subsection[lrCharge]{Postfix-charge model}

In \cite{AlexanderssonUhlin2020} we show that
\[
c^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu} = \left|  T \in \SSYT(\nu, \lambda - \mu) : \charge( \rw(T) \cdot \ell^{\mu_\ell} \dotsm
2^{\mu_2}1^{\mu_1})=0
\right|.
\]
That is, $c^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu}$ is equal 
to the number of semistandard Young tableaux
of shape $\nu$ and content $\lambda - \mu$ such that the reading word postfixed with
$\ell^{\mu_\ell} \dotsm 2^{\mu_2}1^{\mu_1}$ has \hyperref[kostkaFoulkes]{charge} equal to zero.


\begin{example*}[Postfix-charge model]
Let us compute $c^{33221}_{221,321}$, where
$\lambda = 33221$, $\mu = 221$ and $\nu = 321$.
We are interested in semistandard tableaux with shape $321$ and content $\lambda-\mu = 11121$.
There are eight such tableaux.
\begin{figure}
\ytableaushort{144,25,3}\ytableaushort{135,24,4}\ytableaushort{134,25,4}\ytableaushort{134,24,5}
\ytableaushort{125,34,4}\ytableaushort{124,35,4}\ytableaushort{124,34,5}\ytableaushort{123,44,5}
\end{figure}
We take their reading words and concatenate $\ell^{\mu_\ell} \dotsm 2^{\mu_2}1^{\mu_1} = 32211$ at the end.
\begin{array}{ll}
\toprule
\text{Word} & \text{Charge} \\
\midrule
 32514432211 & 1 \\
 42413532211 & 1 \\
 42513432211 & 0 \\
 52413432211 & 0 \\
 43412532211 & 2 \\
 43512432211 & 1 \\
 53412432211 & 2 \\
 54412332211 & 1 \\
\bottomrule
\end{array}
As we see, the third and fourth tableau above give charge $0$, so $c^{33221}_{221,321}=2$.
\end{example*}

\begin{example*}[Postfix-charge model II]
Let us compute $c^{542}_{32,321} = c^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu}$. 
We are interested in semistandard tableaux with shape $321$ and content $\lambda-\mu = 222$.
There are two such tableaux.
\begin{figure}
\ytableaushort{113,22,3}
\ytableaushort{112,23,3}
\end{figure}
We take their reading words and concatenate $22111$ at the end,
$322113\;22111$ and $323112\;22111$.
Both of these words have charge $0$, so $c^{542}_{32,321}=2$.

\subsection[bzPatterns]{Berenstein--Zelevinsky patterns}

Berenstein and Zelevinsky \cite{BerensteinZelevinsky1992}
gave a combinatorial model for the Littlewood--Richardson
coefficients that uses certain triangular arrays,
reminiscent of \hyperref[gtpatterns]{Gelfand--Tsetlin patterns}.
The exact definition is written in an accessible mannar in \cite[Def. A1.3.10]{StanleyEC2}.


\subsection[knutsonTaoHoneycomb]{Knutson--Tao honeycombs}


\subsection[knutsonTaoWoodwardPuzzles]{Knutson--Tao--Woodward puzzles}

Knutson--Tao--Woodward puzzles \cite{KnutsonTau1999,KnutsonTaoWoodward2004} is a different model
used for proving the saturation conjecture.
A nice overview of the saturation conjecture is given by A. Buch \cite{Buch2000}.




\subsection[steinbergLRFormula]{Steinberg's formula}

One can express the \hyperref[schurLittlewoodRichardson]{Littlewood--Richardson coefficients} 
as a signed sum involving the \hyperref[kostantPartitionFunction]{Kostant partition function},
by using Steinberg's formula \cite{Steinberg1961}.

See the exact formula in the section 
with the \hyperref[littlewoodRichardsonFromKostant]{Littlewood--Richardson coefficiens from the Kostant partition function}.



\subsection[socleTableaux]{Socle tableaux}


In \cite{KosakowskaSchmidmeier2022}, $c^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu}$
is realized as the number of \emph{socle tableaux} of shape $\lambda/\nu$ and content $\mu$.
Note that the role of $\mu$ and $\nu$ have been interchanged.

A \defin{socle tableau} is weakly decreasing in rows, strictly decreasing in columns,
and for each vertical line and integer $\ell$, there are 
at most as many entries $\ell+1$ on the left hand side, as entries $\ell$.


\subsection[lrExplicitFormula]{Evaluating Schur functions at roots of unity}

W. Wen gives a fairly explicit formula 
for Littlewood--Richardson coefficients, as a sum over partitions,
where the terms include a product of three Schur functions, evaluated at certain roots of unity, see \cite{Wen2021x}.



\section[newellLittlewood]{Newell--Littlewood numbers}

The \defin{Newel--Littlewood numbers} may be defined as
\[
 N_{\mu,\nu,\lambda} = \sum_{\alpha,\beta,\gamma} c^{\mu}_{\alpha\beta} c^{\nu}_{\alpha\gamma} c^{\lambda}_{\beta\gamma}.
\]
For recent papers on these coefficients, see \cite{GaoOrelowitzYong2020x,GaoOrelowitzYong2020IIx}.

The Littlewood--Richardson coefficients arise as tensor product multiplicities of irreducible representations of $\GL(V)$.
The Newel--Littlewood numbers arise in the same manner, where $\GL(V)$ is replaced by a Lie group of type $B$, $C$ or $D$.

There is a symmetric function basis, the \defin{Koike--Terada basis}, $\{\schurS_{[\lambda]}\}_\lambda$
for which the $N_{\mu,\nu,\lambda}$ serve as multiplication structure constants.
An explicit Jacobi--Trudi type formula for this basis is given in \cite{GaoOrelowitzYong2020x}.

In \cite[Thm. 5.1]{GaoOrelowitzYong2020x}, a polytope description for $N_{\mu,\nu,\lambda}$ is given,
and a saturation-type conjecture is stated. See also \cite{King2021x} for more conjectures.
The saturation conjecture for the Newell--Littlewood numbers has since been proved in \cite{Min2024x}.

\section[lrStretched]{Stretched Littlewood--Richardson coefficients}

The Littlewood--Richardson coefficients are in correspondence with lattice points in certain rational polytopes,
as proved in \cite{BerensteinZelevinsky1988}. 
Consequently, it is immediate that this function is a \emph{quasi}-polynomial,
since we can model this as the Ehrhart (quasi)polynomial of a rational polytope.
Polynomiality was later proved by H. Derksen and J. Weyman \cite{DerksenWeyman2002}, and E. Rassart \cite{Rassart2004}.
A simple proof of polynomiality is given in \cite{Thawinrak2022x}. 
The proof uses the \hyperref[kostantPartitionFunction]{Kostant partition function} formula due to Steinberg.




\begin{conjecture}[See \cite{KingTolluToumazet2004}]
The function
\[
t \to c^{t \nu}_{t\lambda,t\mu}
\]
for fixed partitions, is a polynomial in $t$. 
Note that this is the Ehrhart polynomial of the corresponding BZ-polytope (where lattice points are BZ-patterns).

Computer experiments, see \cite{KingTolluToumazet2004}, suggests that the Ehrhart polynomial above has non-negative coefficients.
This conjecture is still open. 
A special case of this conjecture is to consider the map $t \to K_{t\lambda,t\mu}$,
of so called \emph{stretched Kostka coefficients}.
Various aspects of this problem has been considered in 
\cite{Alexandersson2016GTPoly,Alexandersson2019CounterExamples}.
\end{conjecture}

Fulton's conjecture stated that $c^{\nu}_{\lambda,\mu}=1$ implies that
$c^{t \nu}_{t\lambda,t\mu}=1$ for all $t \geq 1$. This was later proved in \cite{KnutsonTaoWoodward2004}.
The next natural case is, $c^{\nu}_{\lambda,\mu}=2$ and 
it is proved by C. Ikenmenyer \cite{Ikenmeyer2016} and later C. Sherman \cite{Sherman2015x,Sherman2017} that
\[
c^{\nu}_{\lambda,\mu}=2 \implies c^{t \nu}_{t\lambda,t\mu}=t+1.
\]

A nice generalization of this implication is given in \cite{ChaputRessayre2022x},
where it is proved that
\[
c^{\nu}_{\lambda,\mu}=2 \implies c^{\nu(s,t)}_{\lambda(s,t),\mu(s,t)}=\binom{s+t}{t},
\]
with the convention that $\lambda(s,t) \coloneqq s (t \lambda')'$ (i.e., we stretch in both vertical and horizontal direction).


Stretching of Newell--Littlewood coefficients is studied in \cite{King2021x}.
This preprint conttains lots of interesting conjectures analogous to results/conjectures about the Littlewood--Richardson
coefficients. R. C. King proves that the map $t \to n^{t \nu}_{t\lambda,t\mu}$
is a quasipolynomial with period at most 2.


\section[lrIdentities]{Identities}


\subsection[lrCoquereauxZuber]{Coquereaux--Zuber relation}

Let $\mu, \nu \vdash n$ be such that all entries are at most $k$.
In \cite{CoquereauxZuber2011}, it is proved that 
\[
 \sum_{\lambda \vdash n} c^{\lambda}_{\mu, \nu} = 
 \sum_{\lambda \vdash n} c^{\lambda}_{\mu^{\vee k}, \nu},
\]
where $\mu^{\vee k} \coloneqq (k-\lambda_n,\dotsc,k-\lambda_2,k-\lambda_1)$.



\subsection[harrisWillenbring]{The Harris--Willenbring identity}

See \url{https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4939-1590-3_11}

\[
 \sum_{n \geq 0} \sum_{\lambda,\mu, \nu \vdash n} \left( c^{\lambda}_{\mu\nu} \right)^2 t^{|\mu|}q^{|\nu|} = \prod_{i \geq 1} \frac{1}{1-t^i-q^i}
\]



\subsection[lrShrivastava]{Shrivastava's relation with Kostka numbers}

In \cite{Shrivastava2022x}, Shrivastava shows how one can compute Littlewood--Richardson coefficients
as a signed sum of Kostka coefficients.

It is known that (skew) Kostka coefficients can be obtained as a \hyperref[kostkaFromLR]{special case of Littlewood--Richardson coefficients},
see e.g. \cite[p. 338, Eq. 7.61]{StanleyEC2}.




\section[lrcalc]{Computing coefficients, and A. Buch's lrcalc}

H. Narayanan proved in 2006 that computing Littlewood--Richardson coefficients and 
Kostka coefficients is in general $\#P$-complete, see \cite{Narayanan2006}.
This implies that there are no efficient
algorithms for computing these quantities 
(assuming wildly believed conjectures regarding complexity theory).

Anders Buch has a fast C program, \href{https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~asbuch/lrcalc/}{lrcalc}, for computing
Littlewood--Richardson coefficients.

See also Matthew J. Samuel's \href{https://pypi.org/project/schubmult/}{python package for computing products of Schubert polynomials} which, in particular, can compute Littlewood--Richardson coefficients.
