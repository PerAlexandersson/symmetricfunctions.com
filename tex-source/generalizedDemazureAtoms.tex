The family of polynomials referred to as \emph{generalized Demazure atoms}
were introduced in \cite{HaglundMasonRemmel2012} and further studied in \cite{RemmelTiefenbruck2013}.

The generalized Demazure atoms are related to the fillings in the combinatorial model for non-symmetric 
Macdonald polynomials, \cite{HaglundHaimanLoehr2008} and
permuted-basement Macdonald polynomials, \cite{Alexandersson2015gbMacdonald},
but the definitions differ.
The families studied in \cite{Alexandersson2015gbMacdonald} and \cite{AlexanderssonSawhney2019}
are referred to as \emph{permuted-basement atoms} and are not the same as 
generalized Demazure atoms.

The generalized Demazure atoms have nice properties with respect to insertion algorithms and RSK,
while the permuted-basement atoms are compatible with Demzure--Luzstig operators and representation theory.
