A $K$-theoretical analog of the chromatic symmetric functions were introduced in \cite{CrewPechenikSpirkl2023x},
called the \defin{kromatic symmetric functions}.
These serves as a non-homogeneous lift of the \hyperref[chromaticQuasisymmetricDefinition]{chromatic symmetric functions} introduced by Stanley \cite{Stanley1995}.
One main feature is that these expand positively into Grothendieck symmetric functions 
whenever the graph is a claw-free incomparability graph of a poset.

The kromatic symmetric functions are believed to distinguish all graphs, see \cite{Pierson2024x}.
