\section[polynomialIndex]{Index of polynomials}

Below is the list of all families of symmetric functions
and related families of polynomials currently covered.

Next to each link is the vector space where they live,
year when they were introduced, and my personal judgement 
of how much information I have managed to write down about 
the family.
