\section[lagrangeInversion]{Lagrange inversion}

Lagrange inversion is a method to extract formal power series coefficients,
from the functional inverse of a power series, see \cite{Wilf1994}.
A proof by induction can be found in \cite{SuryaWarnke2023x}.

\begin{theorem}
Let $f(u)$ and $\phi(u)$ be formal power series,
with $\phi(0)=1$. Then there is a unique formal power series $u(t)$
solving $u(t)= t\cdot\phi(u(t))$. Moreover,
\[
 [t^n] f(u(t)) = \frac{1}{n}[u^{n-1}]\{ f'(u)\phi(u)^n \}.
\]
\end{theorem}

One particular consequence is the following (when taking $f(x)=x$):

\begin{theorem}
Let $u(x)$ satisfy the equation $u(x) = x \cdot R(u(x))$.
Then 
\[
  [x^n]u = \frac{1}{n} [x^{n-1}] R(x)^n.
\]
\end{theorem}

This allows us to find the generating functions (and closed-form formulas)
for the Fuss--Catalan numbers.
