Subject: Request for Python 3.9+ Installation

Hi inleed.net Support,

I'm currently using your shared hosting service and would like to deploy a Python web application to my account.

The server currently has Python 3.6.8 installed, which is end-of-life (last supported in December 2021) and has known security vulnerabilities.

Could you please install Python 3.9 or newer (preferably Python 3.10 or 3.11) on my server, or make it available for my account?

If you need any additional information or if there's a specific process to request this, please let me know.

Account details:
- Username: symmetricf
- Server: ns12.inleed.net
- Domain: symmetricfunctions.com

Thank you for your assistance!

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Subject: Python Version Upgrade Request

Hello,

Could you please update Python to version 3.9+ on my account (symmetricf@ns12.inleed.net)?

The current version (3.6.8) is end-of-life and I need a newer version to run modern Python applications.

Thank you!
